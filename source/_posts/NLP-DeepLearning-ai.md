# 1. Task: text classification



## 法1: Logsitc回归





## 法2: Naive Bayes

> Naive Bayes is an example of **supervised machine learnin**g, and shares **many similarities with the logistic regression** method 

### Why Naive?

this method makes the assumption that **the features you're using for classification are <u>all independent</u>**, which in reality is **rarely the case**.



但依然可以用于**<u>简单的分类</u>**问题

 it still works nicely as a **simple method for sentiment analysis.**
